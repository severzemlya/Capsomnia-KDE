# Releasing Capsomnia

Capsomnia releases publish two package assets:

- `Capsomnia-<version>.pkg` for immutable versioned downloads
- `Capsomnia.pkg` for stable `releases/latest/download/Capsomnia.pkg` links

## Version Updates

Before building a release, update:

- `resources/Info.plist`: `CFBundleShortVersionString`
- `resources/Info.plist`: `CFBundleVersion`
- `README.md`: current version
- `README.ja.md`: current version
- `CHANGELOG.md`: release entry

Download links should point to `Capsomnia.pkg`, not a versioned asset name.

## Build

```sh
./scripts/build-pkg.sh
```

This writes a signed versioned package to `dist/Capsomnia-<version>.pkg`.

CI builds the same package payload without signing and verifies that every BOM entry is owned by `root:wheel` and that no AppleDouble entries remain:

```sh
SKIP_SIGNING=true ./scripts/build-pkg.sh /tmp/capsomnia-pkg
```

## Notarize

```sh
./scripts/notarize-pkg.sh
```

This submits the versioned package to Apple, staples the accepted ticket, verifies the package, copies it to `dist/Capsomnia.pkg`, and writes `dist/SHA256SUMS.txt`.

The script uses the Keychain profile named `capsomnia-notary` by default. Override it with:

```sh
NOTARY_PROFILE=your-profile ./scripts/notarize-pkg.sh
```

## GitHub Release

After committing and tagging:

```sh
gh release create v<version> \
  dist/Capsomnia-<version>.pkg \
  dist/Capsomnia.pkg \
  dist/SHA256SUMS.txt \
  --title "Capsomnia <version>" \
  --notes-file /path/to/release-notes.md
```

Then verify:

```sh
curl -I -L https://github.com/fuji-mak/Capsomnia/releases/latest/download/Capsomnia.pkg
spctl --assess --type install --verbose dist/Capsomnia.pkg
pkgutil --check-signature dist/Capsomnia.pkg
```
