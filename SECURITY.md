# Security Policy

## Security Updates

Security fixes are provided only for the latest release. Older releases are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for sensitive security reports.

Report sensitive vulnerabilities by contacting the project maintainer on X:

- X: https://x.com/tf_makimaki
- Repository: https://github.com/fuji-mak/Capsomnia
- Maintainer: https://github.com/fuji-mak

For non-sensitive bugs or documentation issues, opening a public GitHub issue is fine.

Please include:

- A short summary of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce.
- The macOS version.
- Whether the issue affects install, uninstall, sudoers, the privileged helper, or runtime behavior.

## Security Model

Capsomnia's menu bar app runs as the current user. It does not run as root.

Capsomnia itself does not make network requests, collect telemetry, or require an account.

Capsomnia does not request Input Monitoring or read keyboard events. It checks only the local Caps Lock state every 250 milliseconds.

System sleep settings require elevated privileges, so Capsomnia installs a small root-owned helper at:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset
```

The sudoers rule only permits the current user to run:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset on
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset off
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset display-sleep
```

The helper only accepts `on`, `off`, and `display-sleep`. It only calls `/usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep` or `/usr/bin/pmset displaysleepnow`.

Package installs keep `/Applications/Capsomnia.app`, the helper, and the system LaunchAgent owned by `root:wheel`. The app process still runs as the signed-in user. If the helper cannot apply a sleep-state change, Capsomnia shows a red status indicator and retries instead of reporting the requested state as active.
