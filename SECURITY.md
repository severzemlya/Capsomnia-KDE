## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for sensitive security reports.

Report vulnerabilities by contacting the project maintainer through GitHub:

- Repository: https://github.com/fuji-mak/Capsomnia
- Maintainer: https://github.com/fuji-mak

Please include:

- A short summary of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce.
- The macOS version.
- Whether the issue affects install, uninstall, sudoers, the privileged helper, or runtime behavior.

## Security Model

Capsomnia's menu bar app runs as the current user. It does not run as root.

System sleep settings require elevated privileges, so Capsomnia installs a small root-owned helper at:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset
```

The sudoers rule only permits the current user to run:

```text
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset on
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/capsomnia-pmset off
```

The helper only accepts `on` and `off`, and only calls `/usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep`.
